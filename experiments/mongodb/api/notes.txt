Notes from my Homebrew install of MongoDB. Cause I don't remember this kind of stuff:


To have launchd start mongodb at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

Then to load mongodb now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist

Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
